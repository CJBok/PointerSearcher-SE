This fork change the file format used by the application and enable data exchange with EdiZon SE. 

Features:
1. Much smaller transfer size between switch and PC. Only transfer data that is needed.
2. No more manual entry for attributes of the dump. Just pick the dump and start the read.
3. No need to manually encode for cheats. Memory hack cheat code can be generated by EdiZon SE and automatically inserted into the (buildID).txt file. 

For more details please refer to https://github.com/tomvita/EdiZon-SE/wiki.

Wireless dump directly from switch:
To use this feature you need to install my noexs sysmodule fork. https://github.com/tomvita/Noexes/releases/latest
On the switch run the game and use EdiZon SE to find the memory address you want to look for pointer chain. 

1. Enter Switch IP address. 
2. Click on "Attach to game" will connect to switch and pause the game. 
3. Clock on "Get Bookmark from EdiZon SE" to fetch the addresses from the bookmark list. EdiZon SE must not be running. If you see the box turn red press "HOME" on switch to quit EdiZon SE and try again. Copy target address. 
4. Click on "Dump ptr" will start the dump. Wait for the dump to be completed.
5. After setting search option below, click on "Reset and Search".  
Max Depth : Max pointer depth  
Offset Range : Search range from target/pointer located address  
Offset Num : Search num of nearest pointed address from target/pointer located address  
6. If there is too many result restart the game and make additional dump(repeat the above steps). Click on "Narrow down result" to reduce the number. 
7. Click on "Export to Bookmark Export File". 
8. Click on "Push Bookmakr Export File to EdiZon SE"

# Pointer Searcher
## warning
* this tool is alpha version,and may has many bugs.please use at yourown risk  
* this tool uses huge amout of memory,maybe more than 400 MB.
* each process is very slow.  
* I'm not going to fix bug,improve memory usage and calculating speed,enhancement.  
so don't request to me.  

## how to use
### preparing
1. dump all r/w memory by using Noexs and search non static address(target address you want to make a pointer code).
1. memo main start address,main end address,heap start address, heap end address and target address.  
it's better to restart game,and dump another data and memo to narrow down search results.

### search pointer
1. launch pointer searcher  
1. fill out 1st row  
1. select `Read 1st Dump Data` button  
this process will takes few minutes  
`Reset and Search` button will be enabled when process finished  
1. After setting search option below,select `Read 1st Dump Data` button  
Max Depth : Max pointer depth  
Offset Range : Search range from target/pointer located address  
Offset Num : Search num of nearest pointed address from target/pointer located address  
For example,If Offset Num=1,you will find`[[main+B000]+10]+100` in the case below  
And if Offset Num=2,you will find`[[main+A000]+20]+200` in addition  
![num](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59052622/71303971-1b50bf80-2403-11ea-87f0-478df77e75c7.png)  
calculating cost will be O(N<sup>N*D</sup>) (D:Max Depth,N:Offset Num)  
1. If too many results,get another dump data and fill out 2nd and subsequent row,select `Narrow Down Result`  
If narrow down results with target address 0,tool only checks if pointer code can reaches heap region  
If narrow down results with target address not 0,tool checks if pointer code can reaches target address
